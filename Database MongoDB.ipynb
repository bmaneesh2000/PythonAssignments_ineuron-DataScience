    "#Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "MongoDB is a scalable, flexible NoSQL document database platform designed to overcome the relational databases approach and the limitations of other NoSQL solutions. \n",
    "MongoDB is well known for its horizontal scaling and load balancing capabilities, which has given application developers an unprecedented level of flexibility and scalability.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Features\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\" \n",
    "Schema-less Database: \n",
    "\n",
    "It is the great feature provided by the MongoDB. A Schema-less database means one collection can hold different types of documents in it. \n",
    "Or in other words, in the MongoDB database, a single collection can hold multiple documents and these documents may consist of the different numbers of fields, content, and size. \n",
    "It is not necessary that the one document is similar to another document like in the relational databases. \n",
    "Due to this cool feature, MongoDB provides great flexibility to databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document Oriented:\n",
    "\n",
    "In MongoDB, all the data stored in the documents instead of tables like in RDBMS. \n",
    "In these documents, the data is stored in fields(key-value pair) instead of rows and columns which make the data much more flexible in comparison to RDBMS. \n",
    "And each document contains its unique object id.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: \n",
    "\n",
    "In MongoDB database, every field in the documents is indexed with primary and secondary indices this makes easier and takes less time to get data . \n",
    "If the data is not indexed, then database search each document with the specified query which takes lots of time and not so efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB provides horizontal scalability with the help of sharding. Sharding means to distribute data on multiple servers, \n",
    "here a large amount of data is partitioned into data chunks using the shard key, \n",
    "and these data chunks are evenly distributed across shards that reside across many physical servers. \n",
    "It will also add new machines to a running database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication: \n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB provides high availability and redundancy with the help of replication, \n",
    "it creates multiple copies of the data and sends these copies to a different server so that if one server fails, \n",
    "then the data is retrieved from another server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation: \n",
    "\n",
    "It allows to perform operations on the grouped data and get a single result or computed result. \n",
    "It is similar to the SQL GROUPBY clause. It provides three different aggregations \n",
    "i.e, aggregation pipeline, map-reduce function, and single-purpose aggregation methods\n",
    "\n",
    "High Performance: \n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of MongoDB is very high and data persistence as compared to another database due to its features like scalability, indexing, replication, etc.\n",
